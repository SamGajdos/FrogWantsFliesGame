# FrogWantsFliesGame
Hello this is a simple puzzle game made in Phaser3.

The main point of the game is collect all golden flies and get to the finish position.
You have to be careful though. After you pass a path (a lilly), the path will dissapear.
You can press "R" for restarting a level. 

During this project I was also learning OOP programming and Javascript language as whole.
