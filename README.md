# FrogWantsFliesGame
Hello, this is a very simple puzzler game made in Phaser3.

The main point of the game is to collect all golden flies and get to the finish position.
After you pass a water lily path, it sinks and cannot be passed over again. Becareful not to trap yourself.
You can press "R" for restarting a level. 

During this project, I was also learning OOP programming and Javascript language as a whole.

Inspiration of the game: The Misadventures of Randolph Doogleberry
