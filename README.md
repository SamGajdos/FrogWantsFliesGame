# FrogWantsFliesGame
Hello, this is a simple puzzle game made in Phaser3.

The main point of the game is to collect all golden flies and get to the finish position.
You have to be careful though. After you pass a path (a water lily), the path will disappear.
You can press "R" for restarting a level. 

During this project, I was also learning OOP programming and Javascript language as a whole.
